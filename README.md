# ray-tracing-1-weekend

In this little project I try to cover three things I want to learn. The main thing I want to understand is how ray tracing actually works following *"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"* (by Peter Sherly), then I want to practice with cpp and git.

PS. have a nice day if you read this
